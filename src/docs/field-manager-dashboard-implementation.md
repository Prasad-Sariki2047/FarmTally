## Data Models

### Field Operation Status Enum
```typescript
enum FieldOperationStatus {
  ASSIGNED = 'assigned',
  IN_PROGRESS = 'in_progress',
  COMPLETED = 'completed',
  ON_HOLD = 'on_hold',
  CANCELLED = 'cancelled'
}
```

### Core Interfaces

#### FieldManagerDashboardView
- **widgets**: Rendered dashboard widgets
- **farmAdminConnection**: Connection status and permissions
- **fieldOperations**: Active operations and updates
- **sharedData**: Farm and supply chain data access
- **quickActions**: Context-sensitive action buttons
- **notifications**: System and operation alerts

#### FieldOperationSummary
- **Operation Details**: Title, description, status, priority
- **Timeline**: Assigned date, due date, completion date
- **Location**: Field location and crop type
- **Progress**: Completion percentage and overdue status

#### SharedFarmData
- **Farm Overview**: Total acreage, active crops, weather conditions
- **Field Data**: Individual field status, crop stages, irrigation
- **Equipment Status**: Availability, maintenance schedules
- **Input Inventory**: Stock levels, expiry dates, low stock alerts

## API Endpoints

### Dashboard Management
- `GET /field-manager/{id}/dashboard` - Load complete dashboard
- `GET /field-manager/{id}/dashboard/refresh` - Refresh dashboard data

### Field Operations
- `GET /field-manager/{id}/operations` - Get field operations
- `PUT /field-manager/{id}/operations/{operationId}/status` - Update operation status
- `POST /field-manager/{id}/operations/updates` - Create operation update
- `GET /field-manager/{id}/operations/history` - Get operation history

### Shared Data Access
- `GET /field-manager/{id}/shared/farm-data` - Get shared farm data
- `GET /field-manager/{id}/shared/supply-chain` - Get supply chain data
- `GET /field-manager/{id}/farm-admin/connection` - Get Farm Admin connection info

### Communication
- `GET /field-manager/{id}/communications` - Get communication logs
- `POST /field-manager/{id}/communications/send` - Send message to Farm Admin
- `PUT /field-manager/{id}/communications/read` - Mark messages as read

## Implementation Details

### Dashboard Loading Process
1. **Authentication Verification**: Validate Field Manager identity and permissions
2. **Farm Admin Relationship**: Load active relationship with Farm Admin
3. **Widget Rendering**: Generate role-specific dashboard widgets
4. **Data Synchronization**: Load shared farm and supply chain data
5. **Operation Loading**: Fetch active and recent field operations
6. **Notification Generation**: Create contextual alerts and notifications

### Real-time Data Synchronization
- **Shared Data Access**: Direct access to Farm Admin's farm data with appropriate permissions
- **Operation Updates**: Real-time synchronization of operation status changes
- **Communication**: Instant messaging and notification delivery
- **Equipment Status**: Live updates on equipment availability and maintenance

### Permission Management
Field Managers have specific permissions based on their relationship with the Farm Admin:
- **canReadFarmData**: Access to farm overview and field data
- **canUpdateFieldOperations**: Ability to update operation status and progress
- **canCreateReports**: Generate field operation reports
- **canViewSupplyChain**: Access to commodity schedules and delivery status
- **canCommunicate**: Send messages and receive notifications

### Security Considerations
- **Relationship Validation**: Ensure Field Manager has active relationship with Farm Admin
- **Data Isolation**: Access only to data from associated Farm Admin
- **Operation Permissions**: Can only update operations assigned to them
- **Audit Logging**: All operation updates and communications are logged

## Usage Examples

### Updating Operation Status
```typescript
const result = await fieldManagerRoutes.updateOperationStatus(
  'fm-123',
  'op-456',
  'in_progress',
  'Started irrigation system setup'
);
```

### Creating Operation Update
```typescript
const updateData = {
  operationId: 'op-456',
  status: FieldOperationStatus.IN_PROGRESS,
  progress: 75,
  notes: 'Irrigation system 75% complete, expected completion tomorrow',
  location: 'Field A-1'
};

const result = await fieldManagerRoutes.createOperationUpdate('fm-123', updateData);
```

### Accessing Shared Farm Data
```typescript
const farmData = await fieldManagerRoutes.getSharedFarmData('fm-123');
// Returns: farm overview, field data, equipment status, input inventory
```

## Integration Points

### Business Relationship Service
- Validates Field Manager's relationship with Farm Admin
- Manages permissions and data access rights
- Handles invitation acceptance and relationship establishment

### Supply Chain Repository
- Provides access to commodity schedules and delivery status
- Shares market price information and trends
- Enables supply chain visibility for field planning

### Widget Renderer Service
- Renders role-specific dashboard widgets
- Customizes widget content based on Field Manager permissions
- Provides interactive operation management interfaces

### Communication Service
- Handles real-time messaging with Farm Admin
- Manages notification delivery and read status
- Supports file attachments and operation-related communications

## Testing Considerations

### Unit Tests
- Field operation status update validation
- Shared data access permission checking
- Communication message handling
- Dashboard data loading and rendering

### Integration Tests
- Complete Field Manager workflow from login to operation completion
- Real-time data synchronization with Farm Admin changes
- Cross-role communication and notification delivery
- Permission enforcement across different data types

### Security Tests
- Unauthorized access prevention
- Data isolation between different Farm Admin relationships
- Operation update permission validation
- Communication privacy and security

## Performance Optimization

### Data Loading
- **Lazy Loading**: Load detailed operation data on demand
- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed farm data and equipment status
- **Pagination**: Paginate operation history and communication logs
- **Real-time Updates**: Use WebSocket connections for live data synchronization

### Dashboard Rendering
- **Widget Optimization**: Render only visible widgets initially
- **Data Aggregation**: Pre-calculate operation summaries and statistics
- **Image Optimization**: Compress field photos and equipment images
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Optimize for field-based mobile usage

This implementation provides Field Managers with a comprehensive, real-time interface for managing field operations while maintaining secure, permission-based access to shared farm data and seamless communication with Farm Admins.
